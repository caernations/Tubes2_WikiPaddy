> WikiRacer is a sophisticated online platform designed to navigate the vast network of Wikipedia articles using advanced graph traversal algorithms. It enables users to input start and end Wikipedia articles, then utilizes Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) techniques to discover the shortest path between them. The website offers a user-friendly interface where participants can directly submit their queries, watch the progress of the search in real-time, and view a visual representation of the path through interconnected articles.
